But when Gary's lesbian daughter calls in and commits suicide on the air, he prays that God will give him a second chance to save her. And God grants Gary's wish, but with an unexpected twist. The following day, Gary awakens to discover that not only has he been transformed into a gay man, but time has also been turned back two weeks.
