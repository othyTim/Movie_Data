Fleming's acting captures the complexity of the character and her vocalism is flawless. She negotiates the wild coloratura of Act One with aplomb, and is stunning in the lyric passages that pervade the opera, and touching in her scenes with her lover, Alfredo, and his father.

Made with the ever-generous currency of a cast and crew of friends, and the ample downtime that Greek summer-in-the-city affords, when everybody else is sunning and hooking up out in the islands, it's a film about two exiles -- in Athens, in summer, in love. A sentimental dance between a girl and a boy who could be stuck in downtown any-ville, yearning to be with each other but too cool to dare, too chicken to admit it, too clumsy not to step on each other's Doc Martens, and too damn sentimental not to surrender, in the end, to that old-fashioned thing called love.",0.661,/1cEBeOcuvvog1sJU3cho3JDwWL2.jpg,"[{'id': 4045, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Cinegram', 'origin_country': 'GR'}, {'id': 7254, 'logo_path': '/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png', 'name': 'Greek Film Centre', 'origin_country': 'GR'}, {'id': 7255, 'logo_path': '/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png', 'name': 'EPT', 'origin_country': 'GR'}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'GR', 'name': 'Greece'}]",2008-04-03,0.0,109.0,"[{'english_name': 'Greek', 'iso_639_1': 'el', 'name': 'ελληνικά'}]",Released,,Valse Sentimentale,0.0,2.0,2.0,

Recorded during their Sucks Blood era in 2007, the performances include songs from previous albums, as well as others that were unreleased at the time. Some of those that had not appeared on any album were later reworked for 2008's The Master's Bedroom is Worth Spending a Night In, here performed in the more subdued psychedelic folk manner which characterized the band's sound during this period. This album was the final appearance of percussionist Patrick Mullins, who left the band after ""Sucks Blood"".  The live footage on the DVD was filmed over the course of four days in San Francisco.[1] It features the band performing in mostly unconventional locales, such as on the shoulder of a highway and near the beach. The video footage was directed by Brian Lee Hughes.",0.84,/fI6iur7G7ip7909ipU0D7kDgKAO.jpg,[],[],2008-08-25,0.0,59.0,[],Released,,Thee Hounds of Foggy Notion,0.0,8.0,1.0,
